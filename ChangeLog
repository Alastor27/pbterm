	allow sending '^C' and '^Z' for job control.

	now can be used as an std::ostream and messages can be logged

	prevented setting a command file fixed.

	* Version 1.3.1: Fix to address the potential problem of CloseApp()
	not immediately shutting down the program on errors starting the
	shell and setting up the communication channels. Thanks to
	'rkomar' from the www.mobilreader.com PocketBook developers forum
	for making me aware of this possibility.
