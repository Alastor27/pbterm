# This is an example for the file with user commands that the program
# expects per default as "/system/share/pbterm/user.cmd" (butyou can
# change the via the configuration files 'user_cmd_file' property).
#
# Each line should contain one command. Empty lines and lines starting
# with a hash mark ('#') are skipped. Commands form lines that end in
# a hash mark will be executed immediately on selection, i.e. without
# the keyboard popping up and letting you edit the command.
